"""host_escape_gate_sites_test.py -- BACKLOG #150 S150-3 step 5 + review F1/F3: the site guard.

pdna_box.c does not compile on the host (it needs tonc/libgba headers this repo's other
pure-C host tests deliberately avoid pulling in), so the only thing that can prove the
escape-route sites from docs/briefs/s150-3-escape-gate-brief.md (plus review F1's
fourteenth route) stay covered is a text-level structural check: does every write path
that can persist a carried/selected 80-byte record still have a gate call
(`xg_native_escape_denied(` or, where the predicate does not apply, `bc_is_native(`
directly) reading BEFORE the write, by line order within the same function body?

This is deliberately dumb (comment-strip + brace-depth function-body extraction +
line-order regex checks), on purpose: a smarter parser could itself hide the exact kind
of refactor that silently drops a gate. Pure Python, stdlib only, never `import mgba`
(RUN_HOST_TESTS convention, see run_host_tests.py's own header comment).

Review F3 (2026-09-15) found two holes in the FIRST version of this file:
  - it never stripped comments, so a gate call sitting only in a /* ... */ block (dead
    prose, not real code) still counted as present;
  - check (a) took `min(gate_line, bc_line)` across BOTH patterns for every site, so a
    site whose REAL pattern (e.g. drop_held's own `xg_native_escape_denied(`) was
    deleted, or moved to AFTER its memcpy, could still pass by accident if some
    UNRELATED `bc_is_native(` call happened to sit earlier in the same body (begin_select
    has one from decision 5; nothing stopped it from masking a deleted drop_held gate
    if the two functions were ever merged or reordered).
Both are fixed here: `strip_comments()` blanks `/*...*/` and `//` text but keeps every
line's own line number (so line-order checks after stripping still point at real source
lines), and each site now checks its OWN specific pattern only -- never a min() over two.
A permanent self-mutation harness (`self_test_mutation_detection()`) proves the checker
still has teeth: it takes the REAL stripped body text, applies the exact two mutations
review F3 asked for (MUT A: delete begin_select's guard; MUT F: move drop_held's gate
block after its five memcpys) to an IN-MEMORY copy, and asserts the per-site check
function reports failure on the mutated copy -- every run, not just when someone
remembers to run the demonstration by hand.

Checks:
  (a) drop_held / drop_chunk: `xg_native_escape_denied(` at a line index BEFORE the
      first 80-byte memcpy line, in the (comment-stripped) function body.
  (a') begin_select: `bc_is_native(` at a line index BEFORE its `memcpy(s_ch_rec[i]`
      copy-into-chunk loop (decision 5 -- a lift has no destination yet, so the escape
      predicate does not apply here).
  (a'') review F1: box_set_held contains `bc_is_native(` before its own
      `memcpy(rec, out, 80)`; item_home contains `bc_is_native(` in its scan (no write
      of its own, so no before/after ordering to check -- presence only).
  (b) the party-place call (app_party_place_held() in pdna_box.c) and the homeless-B
      memcpy line are each preceded, within a few lines, by a gate call.
  (c) app_mon_menu contains bc_is_native(rec) and a dispatch line whitelisting the
      native-cell actions (A_SUMMARY/A_MOVE/A_RELEASE/A_CANCEL -- D-Q1 added VIEW/
      A_SUMMARY to the brief's original three).
  (d) app_mon_menu_readonly (review F4 shape): contains `bc_is_native(rec)` (the
      `ro_native` computation) and a dispatch line whitelisting RO_VIEW/RO_CANCEL only.
  (e) the total count of xg_native_escape_denied( in pdna_box.c is exactly 4 (drop_held,
      drop_chunk, the party site, the homeless B-cancel) -- review F1/F2 use
      bc_is_native() directly, not this predicate, so this count is unchanged by them.
  (f) self_test_mutation_detection(): MUT A and MUT F both make the relevant per-site
      check FAIL, on synthetic mutated copies, every run.
